# THE COVID-19 AI MODEL

### My Attempt at using AI to utilize datasets and other sources of information!!

* Can we use AI to read from general datasets and answer questions from a user?
* Can we bolster those datasets with other information coming from pdfs?
* What if we create a functional "local gpt" based solely off of a specific sector of information?

## All of these questions are what my experiments try to do.
Thank you to Tech with Tim for giving me inspiration for this idea from his videos.

The COVID-19 AI Model incorporates a public dataset from Kaggle involving general information about COVID-19 such as cases and death counts from countries across the world. By specifying that OPENAI's model should use pandas to query the dataset, a user can have their question answered by the AI model.

In addition, by pulling sources such as Wikipedia's page on COVID-19, the user can have their general questions about COVID answered. 

Thus, users can have their experience enhanced by asking an AI focused centrally around one specific topic instead of using data that can be irrelevant.

### Note:
OpenAI has discontinued their free credits for using their API keys so you must pay at a minimum of $5 to access their AI models. To get your API key, you must log in to OpenAI and request an API key. Then just plug it into your .env file with

OPENAI_API_KEY=blah
